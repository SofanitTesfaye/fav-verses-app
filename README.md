## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
I have a good understanding of what i want my application to look like and what exactly I want it to do. And I also know which labs and excercise I can reference if I get lost along the way.

### Weaknesses:
CSS and class copmonents will most likely consume a lots of my time. i'll put more efforts on those areas.
### Opportunities:
This project will give me an opportunity to solidify my understanding of react. I also happen to be interested in the function of my app given my interests, so I am motivated to make it look usable and attractive.

### Threats:
I get frustrated when i'm stuck with errors or an issue, it makes me not utilize my brain effectively
